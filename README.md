This is our detailed algorithm on how the code works: 

**1. Function `isPalindrome(String word)`:**

* **Input:** A string `word`.
* **Step 1: Get the length and convert to lowercase.**
    * Calculate the length of the input string `word` and store it in `n`.
    * Create a new string `lowerCaseWord` by converting all characters in `word` to lowercase using `word.toLowerCase()`. This ensures case-insensitive comparison.
* **Step 2: Iterate through the first half of the string.**
    * Use a `for` loop to iterate from index `i` starting at 0 to less than half the length of the string (`n / 2`).
    * Inside the loop:
        * **Compare characters at opposite ends (lowercase).**
            * Get the character at the current index `i` from `lowerCaseWord.charAt(i)`.
            * Get the character at the mirrored index from the end using `lowerCaseWord.charAt(n - i - 1)`.
            * Compare these two characters.
        * **Early exit if not a palindrome.**
            * If the characters at `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, the word is not a palindrome. Return `false` to stop further processing.
* **Step 3: Word is a palindrome.**
    * If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the word is a palindrome. Return `true` from the function.

**2. Function `main(String[] args)`:**

* **This function demonstrates how to use the `isPalindrome` function.**
* **Step 1: Define a test word.**
    * Declare a string variable `dword` and assign a word (e.g., "Hannah") to it. You can change this to test different words.
* **Step 2: Call the `isPalindrome` function.**
    * Call the `isPalindrome` function with `dword` as an argument and store the returned value (true or false) in a boolean variable `isPalindrome`.
* **Step 3: Print the result.**
    * Use an if-else statement to check the value of `isPalindrome`:
        * If `isPalindrome` is true, print a message saying the word is a palindrome.
        * Otherwise, print a message saying the word is not a palindrome.

This algorithm effectively checks for palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
